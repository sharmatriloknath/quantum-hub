# Quantum Algorithms

Explore quantum algorithms like Grover's and Shor's.

## Grover's Algorithm

Finds a marked item in $O(\sqrt{N})$ time.

```python
# Grover's Algorithm (pseudo-code)
for i in range(sqrt(N)):
    oracle()
    diffusion()
```

## Math Example

$$
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{x=0}^{N-1} |x\rangle
$$
